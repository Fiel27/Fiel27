- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Fiel27, Electrical Engineer, part-time translator, very part-time programmer
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, data collection automation (queries), and others I might haven't found yet
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming in Google Scripts
- I love Music, my genres are usually Indie, Funk, J-Pop, VGM, Classical, uh.... a lot actually but I couldn't think more for now
- I like playing video games, currently hooked on Valheim. I play rhythm games a lot
